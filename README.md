# Office365URLGenerator




Using inspiration from Aaron Guilmette's Office 365 PAC Generator script I have created a Powershell script that looks to the current Office 365 URL xml file, pulls the information down and creates a TXT file with the URLs. 

The contents of the final output file can then be used to help you configure a WPAD/PAC file for your environment.  

You can select to pull all the URLs down or only ones for specific products.
